Manage images from flutter projects easily


Importing images into a flutter projects like pain in ass, so I wrote this tool to do that.

It should be very easy to import if your work invironment is like mine:

  downloading imgages from lanhuapp.com where our design drawing of projects are,

  then unzip the package,
  
  copy these images into a source folder,
  
  then set this source folder into cfg.json as source,
  
  set images folder of your flutter project into cfg.json as destination,
  
  run start_cmd.py,
  
  type import,

  your images from source folder should copied into the images folder now.
  
  
There are some command you can use:

  1. q or quit
  2. set source path
  3. set destination path
  4. show
  5. import
  6. delete name
  7. rename oldname newname
  8. rename_batch old new
